App SDK 2 Test Utilities
=================
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/RallyApps/sdk2-test-utils.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/RallyApps/sdk2-test-utils)

A library of utilities, helpers, and data mocks for writing unit tests for apps written with the [App SDK](https://help.rallydev.com/apps/2.1/doc/).

While this library is distributed as an npm package, it is generally not meant to be installed or used directly.  Instead, it is automatically bundled with and integrated into [Rally App Builder](https://github.com/RallyApps/rally-app-builder#test).

## Getting Started

The [Testing Apps](https://help.rallydev.com/apps/2.1/doc/#!/guide/testing_apps) guide in the App SDK help documentation provides a great overview of what writing unit tests for SDK 2 apps looks like.  Most of the utilities mentioned in that guide live in this repository.
